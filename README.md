# BicepCurlCounter
Implemented a small project to count the number of bicep curl by using mediapipe and open cv to detect motion.

This project doesnt make use of any AI or ML models. Just a small project done using mediapipe and opencv libraries in python. 


Squat Curl needs some updation, but the priniciple idea has been implemented. Will keep you updated
